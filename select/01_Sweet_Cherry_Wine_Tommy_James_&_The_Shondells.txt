C'mon, everyone, we got to get together now
Oh, yeah, love's the only thing that matters anyhow
And the beauty of life
Can only survive
If we love one another

Oh, yeah, yesterday my friends were marching out to war
Oh, yeah, listen, now, we ain't a-marching anymore
No, we ain't gonna fight
Only God has the right
To decide who's to live and die

He gave us sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
(All day and night)
And everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine
Yes, they will

Watch the mountain turn to dust and blow away
Oh, Lord, you know there's got to be a better way
And the old masquerade
Is a no soul parade
Marchin' through the ruins of time

To save us, he gave us
Sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
Everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine

Oh, sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
C'mon, drink it with your brother
Trust in one another
Yeah, yeah
We need each other
Sweet cherry wine
Drink it right down
Pass it all around
People, don't you know
The cup is running over?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Oh
Come on
Come on
Hey (Sweet)
Ooh
Ooh
