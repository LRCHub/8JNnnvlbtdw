Uh uh uh uh uh
Am I too late
Am I too late for the party
Tell them don't start without me
Take your time
Give me five
And I'll be right there
I'll be around the corner
When I'm outside I'll call you
I'm feeling shy
Don't leave my side tonight
I'm not sure I want to be
Out with all these people
No they don't seem my type
Can you pour me something deep
Think I'm gonna need
Something for the edge tonight
My sweet cherry wine
I need you by my side
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
My sweet cherry wine
I need you by my side
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
With the table
Your friends around me
And a boy drinking brandy, uh
He's kind of fine
Should I say hi
But he's getting up
And I've had enough
Won't bother to chase him
I don't even want to be in this place
You're the one that wanted it this way, this way
I'm not sure I want to be
Out with all these people
No, they don't seem my type
Can you pour me something deep
Think I'm gonna need
Something for the edge tonight
Hmmmm
My sweet cherry wine
I need you by my side
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
My sweet cherry wine
I need you by my side
(Need you by my side)
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
My sweet cherry wine
I need you by my side
(Uh no no no)
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
(Uh no uh no uh no)
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
My sweet cherry wine
I need you by my side
(Need you by my side)
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
Oh oh oh oh oh
Because I'm feeling the pressure tonight
Oh oh oh oh oh
Uh uh uh uh uh
