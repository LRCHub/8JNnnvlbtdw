[00:25.34] Her eyes and words are so icy
[00:29.91] Oh, but she burns like rum on the fire
[00:36.85] Hot and fast and angry as she can be
[00:42.48] I walk my days on a wire
[00:54.48] 
[00:48.93] It looks ugly, but it's clean
[00:54.46] Oh, momma, don't fuss over me
[01:08.96] 
[00:58.45] The way she tells me l'm hers and she is mine
[01:04.39] Open hand or close fist would be fine
[01:08.93] The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
[01:29.93] 
[01:20.26] Calls of guilty thrown at me
[01:24.37] All while she stains the sheets of some other
[01:31.25] Thrown at me so powerfully
[01:35.36] Just like she throws with the arm of her brother
[01:59.36] 
[01:43.60] But I want it, it's a crime
[01:48.87] That she's not around most of the time
[02:07.87] 
[01:53.13] The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
[01:58.70] Open hand or closed fist would be fine
[02:03.27] The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
[02:24.27] 
[02:36.35] Her fight and fury is fiery
[02:40.52] Oh, but she loves like sleep to the freezing
[02:47.90] Sweet and right and merciful
[02:51.95] I'm all but washed in the tide of her breathing
[03:15.45] 
[02:59.61] And it's worth it, it's divine
[03:06.17] And I have this some of the time
[03:22.17] 
[03:09.81] The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
[03:15.26] Open hand or closed fist would be fine
[03:20.08] The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
